# GumTree

This repo is forked from [GumTree](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree/).

We mainly add ``TAFormatter`` to output atomic changes in Tuple-Attribute formats, which actually make GumTree a
inter-version facts extractor for multiple languages, thanks to the multiple languages support of GumTree.
We also fix some issues and replace the C parser used.
Currently the GumTree code in this repo is behind the development in official repo (``develop`` branch),
we may merge upstream update in the future.

Following contents come from the original repo.

## Description

GumTree is a complete framework to deal with source code as trees and compute differences between them. It includes possibilities such as:
* converting a source file into a language-agnostic tree format
* export the produced trees in various formats
* compute the differences between the trees
* export these differences in various formats
* visualize these differences graphically

Compared to classical code differencing tools, it has two important particularities:
* it works on a tree structure rather than a text structure,
* it can detect moved or renamed elements in addition of deleted and inserted elements.

## Supported languages

We already deal with a wide range of languages: C, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, Ruby. Click [here](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree/wiki/Languages) for more details about the language we support.

More languages are coming soon, if you want to help contact [me](http://www.labri.fr/perso/falleri).
